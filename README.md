# XBuildTrimble
Challenge provided by Trimble, at the Xbuild.

# So far
From the left and right camera images, on the same sample, I managed to match the keypoints.
I wonder if whatever I've learned can be used for future project.

# Now what?
Go take computer vision classes.
Linear Algebra is a plus, GPU programming makes things fast, and motion estimation related concepts
needs to learned, if I'd like to further pursue the subject I've learned during this hackathon.
